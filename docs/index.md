## Introduction to DevOps

DevOps is a methodology that aims to improve the communication and collaboration between development and operations teams, with the goal of delivering software products more efficiently and reliably. It's a cultural shift that focuses on breaking down the silos between different teams and improving the feedback loop to ensure faster delivery of high-quality software. DevOps aims to achieve continuous delivery and deployment, which is the ability to release new features and updates to customers quickly and efficiently.

## Pillers of devops

The four pillars of DevOps are:

- Culture
- Automation
- Measurement
- Sharing.

The culture pillar emphasizes the need for collaboration, transparency, and shared responsibility among teams.

The automation pillar aims to automate repetitive and manual tasks to reduce errors, increase efficiency, and improve quality.

The measurement pillar focuses on measuring and monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) to continuously improve processes and products.

The sharing pillar emphasizes the need for knowledge sharing and collaboration among teams to improve the overall quality and speed of product delivery.

## Introduction to Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Integration is a software development practice that involves integrating code changes frequently into a shared repository. The idea behind CI is to catch and fix integration issues early in the development cycle before they become bigger problems. In CI, developers commit code changes to a central code repository, which triggers an automated build and test process to verify the changes. If the tests pass, the changes are integrated into the main codebase.

## Continuous Deployment/Delivery (CD)

Continuous Deployment/Delivery is the practice of automatically deploying code changes to production after they pass a series of automated tests. CD aims to reduce the time it takes to release new features and updates to customers while ensuring the quality of the software. In CD, code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to a production environment. If the tests pass, the changes are automatically deployed to production. In Continuous Delivery, the code changes are automatically built and tested, but the deployment to production is triggered manually.
